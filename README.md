#### **`DESCRIPTION`**  
#### Imagine an LLM like ChatGPT from OpenAI or Google Gemini but working **Completely Offline** with **No Restrictions** at all. All with a **look-alike User Interface** using OpenWebUI but also an **On-Device AI API** that you can use to integrate any (Python, as of now) program you write with **a single kernel-level always-active agent** that can talk to the running program and make it more smarter or even correct itself.
